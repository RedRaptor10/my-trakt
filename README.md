# My Trakt

My Trakt is a viewer app that uses the Trakt API and TMDB API to display a user's collection. The app includes a couple of features that are not available in Trakt's user interface, such as displaying a user's recommended items and searching a collection. My Trakt is not affiliated with Trakt or TMDB and is meant for personal use only.
